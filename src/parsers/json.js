/*  JSON "parser" for nabtext.
    
    TODO: Well... everything. Some thoughts:
    
    * Add a callback hook into the overall loading/parsing methods, allowing
      for a custom callback to be run after the loaded JSON (or .mo's, .po's,
      etc.) but before it's actually added to the string dictionary.
